/**
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to write a function named `findFragments` which takes in a array(n x n) and returns 'n' ASCII Characters as fragments to complete the challenge
 *
 * Your implementation should handle arrays whose individual elements are positive integers.
 *
 * A few examples:
 *    `findFragments([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],[6, 7, 8, 9, 10],[11, 12, 13, 14, 15],[16, 17, 18, 19, 20],[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])` should return `AKA7` - four characters as four fragments
 *    `findFragments([[1, 1, 1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]])` should return `0000` - four characters as four fragments
 * **/

export function findFragments(array) {
  //Good luck with solving
}
